# Splay-Tree
My full implementation of Splay Tree in C++ to showcase my C++ skills and knowledge

### How to run it
You can compile the code using command:
`make` 

There are four input files for testing, to run the file, you can use one input file as inputs:
For example: `./SplayTree < input1.txt` 

You can run the command `clean` to clean up the executable.
